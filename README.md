# Shorebird_aquaculture_project;Project assessing the impacts of oyster aquaculture on Red Knots in New Jersey

Up and down the east coast of the US there are growing markets to produce artisanal markets of shellfish via aquaculture. In New Jersey 
such markets exist along many Delaware Bay beaches. These same beaches serve as important stopover sites for many shorebird species, 
including the endangered Red Knot. 

This project aims to assess the potential impacts of the growing aquaculture market on Red Knot abundance using analytical techniques
such as zero-inflated GLMMs. Additional analyses are being conducted to determine the impacts of other human-related activities, as well as,
other biological factors (e.g. shoreline habitat type). Models will be compared using information criterion such as DIC. 

Overall results and recommendations from this study will be passed on to the US Fish and Wildlife Service to determine if any regulatory
mechanisms need to be put in place in regard to the aquaculture activities already taking place along the Delaware Bay.
